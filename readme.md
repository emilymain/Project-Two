# PROJECT TWO 



###CONNECTECH
CONNECTECH is a site that helps connect people in the tech industry with each other. The goal is for users to find collaborators to make their projects and ideas a reality. Users will create profiles and can either post projects or search for projects that are looking for individuals with their skill set. 


####MVP
* Users can create profiles with log in and logout capabilites 
* Users can post projects they are looking for help with 
* Users can search for projects that their skill set could be an asset to. 
* Users can respond to project profiles in order to make connections with the project's creator. 

#####Approach Taken
I used Ruby on Rails to build this application and bootstrap was used to help with styling. The first thing I did was create my database. I used 4 models and 3 join tables. Once I had my models and join tables set up properly, I was able to build the necessary RESTful routes and set up CRUD functionality to fit the purposes of my site.
